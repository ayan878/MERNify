### Installation of Packages

First, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. Then follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a Node.js Project**:
   ```sh
   npm init -y
   ```
   This command creates a `package.json` file with default settings.

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Install `express`, `cors`, and `morgan`:
   ```sh
   npm install express cors morgan
   ```

3. **Enable ES6 Modules in Node.js**:
   To use ES6 `import` syntax, add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "your-project-name",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "main": "index.js",
     "type": "module",
     "scripts": {
       "start": "node index.js"
     },
     "dependencies": {
       "express": "^4.17.1",
       "cors": "^2.8.5",
       "morgan": "^1.10.0"
     }
   }
   ```

### Detailed Explanation of Each Line

#### Import Statements

```javascript
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";
import morgan from "morgan";
```
- **`import express from "express";`**: Imports the `express` module, a minimalist web framework for Node.js, allowing you to create web applications and APIs.
- **`import cors from "cors";`**: Imports the `cors` module, middleware for enabling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), allowing your server to handle requests from different origins.
- **`import morgan from "morgan";`**: Imports the `morgan` module, middleware for logging HTTP requests, useful for debugging and monitoring HTTP request logs.

#### Initialize Express Application

```javascript
const app = express();
```
- **`const app = express();`**: Initializes an Express application by calling the `express` function. The `app` object will be used to define routes and middleware.

#### Middleware Configuration

```javascript
app.use(express.json());
```
- **`app.use(express.json());`**: Adds a middleware function to parse incoming requests with JSON payloads. This middleware is based on `body-parser` and is useful for handling JSON data in request bodies.

```javascript
app.use(cors());
```
- **`app.use(cors());`**: Adds a middleware function to enable CORS. This allows your server to accept requests from other origins (domains), which is particularly useful in web development where you might want your frontend (served from one domain) to communicate with your backend API (served from another domain).

```javascript
app.use(morgan("tiny"));
```
- **`app.use(morgan("tiny"));`**: Adds a middleware function to log HTTP requests in a concise format (specified as "tiny"). This helps in tracking incoming requests and debugging.

The "tiny" argument specifies the format of the logs. Morgan supports several predefined formats for logging, and "tiny" is one of the simplest. The "tiny" format includes:

HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST)
URL (e.g., /home, /api/users)
HTTP version (e.g., HTTP/1.1)
Response status code (e.g., 200, 404)
Response time in milliseconds

GET / 200 0.935 ms - 12


```javascript
app.disable("x-power-by");
```
- **`app.disable("x-power-by");`**: Disables the `X-Powered-By` header, which is included in HTTP responses by default. Removing this header helps obscure the fact that your app is powered by Express, which can be a small security improvement to reduce potential attack vectors.

#### Define Routes

```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.status(201).json("Home GET Request");
});
```
- **`app.get("/", (req, res) => { ... });`**: Defines a route handler for HTTP GET requests to the root URL ("/"). The callback function takes two arguments:
  - **`req`**: The request object representing the HTTP request.
  - **`res`**: The response object used to send a response back to the client.
- **`res.status(201).json("Home GET Request");`**: Sends a JSON response with a status code of 201 (Created) and a message "Home GET Request".

#### Start the Server

```javascript
const port = 8080;
```
- **`const port = 8080;`**: Defines the port number on which the server will listen for incoming requests.

```javascript
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server connected to http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
- **`app.listen(port, () => { ... });`**: Starts the Express server, making it listen on the specified port (8080). The callback function logs a message indicating that the server is running and accessible at the specified URL.

### Why Use ES6 `import` Syntax Instead of CommonJS `require`?

1. **Standardization**: ES6 modules (`import`/`export`) are part of the official ECMAScript standard, making them the future-proof way to handle modules in JavaScript.

2. **Static Analysis**: ES6 imports are statically analyzable, meaning tools can understand and optimize the dependencies at build time, improving performance and allowing for features like tree-shaking.

3. **Readability and Maintainability**: The `import` syntax is more declarative and readable, making it clear what dependencies are being used at the top of the file.

4. **Scoped Imports**: ES6 modules help prevent issues like variable hoisting and maintain a cleaner global scope, avoiding potential conflicts and making code easier to debug.

5. **Compatibility with Modern Tools**: Many modern JavaScript tools and frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) use ES6 module syntax, providing a consistent approach across front-end and back-end development. 

By using ES6 `import` syntax, you align with modern JavaScript practices, benefiting from improved readability, better tooling support, and future-proofing your code.

## MongoDB
The provided code sets up a dummy (in-memory) MongoDB database using `mongodb-memory-server`, which is useful for testing purposes without requiring a real MongoDB server. Here's a detailed explanation of each line:

### Code Explanation

```javascript
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import { MongoMemoryServer } from "mongodb-memory-server";
```
- **`import mongoose from "mongoose";`**: Imports the `mongoose` library, which is used to interact with MongoDB.
- **`import { MongoMemoryServer } from "mongodb-memory-server";`**: Imports the `MongoMemoryServer` class from the `mongodb-memory-server` package. This library allows you to create an in-memory MongoDB instance for testing.

```javascript
async function connect() {
  const mongodb = await MongoMemoryServer.create();
  const getUri = mongodb.getUri();
  const db = await mongoose.connect(getUri);
  console.log("Database connected");
}
```
- **`async function connect() {`**: Defines an asynchronous function named `connect` that sets up the in-memory MongoDB connection.
- **`const mongodb = await MongoMemoryServer.create();`**: Creates a new instance of `MongoMemoryServer` and starts it. This function returns a promise that resolves to the instance.
- **`const getUri = mongodb.getUri();`**: Retrieves the connection URI for the in-memory MongoDB instance.
- **`const db = await mongoose.connect(getUri);`**: Connects to the in-memory MongoDB instance using Mongoose with the retrieved URI. This function returns a promise that resolves to the connection object.
- **`console.log("Database connected");`**: Logs a message to the console indicating that the database connection was successful.

```javascript
export default connect;
```
- **`export default connect;`**: Exports the `connect` function as the default export from the module, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.

### Usage

To use this connection setup in your application, you can import and call the `connect` function in your main application file:

```javascript
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";
import morgan from "morgan";
import connect from "./path-to-your-connect-file";

const app = express();

// Middleware
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors());
app.use(morgan("tiny"));
app.disable("x-powered-by"); // less hackers know about our stack

// Connect to in-memory MongoDB
connect().then(() => {
  console.log("In-memory MongoDB connected");

  // Define routes
  app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.status(201).json("Home GET Request");
  });

  const port = 8080;
  // Start server
  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server connected to http://localhost:${port}`);
  });
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error("Failed to connect to in-memory MongoDB:", error);
});
```

### Explanation

1. **Imports**:
   - Import necessary libraries (`express`, `cors`, `morgan`) and the `connect` function from the file where you defined it.

2. **Middleware Configuration**:
   - Set up Express middleware for parsing JSON, enabling CORS, and logging HTTP requests.

3. **Connect to In-Memory MongoDB**:
   - Call the `connect` function to start the in-memory MongoDB server and connect to it using Mongoose.
   - Log a message indicating the successful connection.

4. **Define Routes and Start the Server**:
   - Define your Express routes as needed.
   - Start the Express server and log the URL where it's running.
